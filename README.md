Quality of white wine is something wine enjoyers pay attention to. This project seeks to quantify and measure the quality of white wine with data. This dataset is white vinho verde wine samples, from the north of Portugal. The goal is to select the best model to judge wine quality based on physicochemical tests. The project applies several machine learning algorithms related to regression to enhance the rating of white wines in quality. Results indicate that the Extra Trees Regressor with boosting ensemble method yields the highest R2 at 0.9953.
